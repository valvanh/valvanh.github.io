Inspired by the concept of Wattpad, this project aims to create a true literary community where everyone's imagination comes to life through original stories.\nThe application offers various features that promote user engagement: publishing chapters, following favorite authors, comments and reactions on works, as well as a personalized recommendation system based on reading preferences. Authors can structure their writings, illustrate their stories and interact directly with their audience to enrich their creative process.\rDeveloped as part of a school project, Wonderin' is the result of a collaboration between a graphic designer and front-end developer and myself, in charge of back-end development with Laravel. My work focused on user management, structuring databases, setting up APIs, as well as optimizing the site's performance and security. Through this experience, I was able to deepen my skills in web development while contributing to a platform designed to encourage creativity and sharing within a dynamic community.",

The main objective was to explore and master the fundamental concepts of web development by designing a dynamic platform where users can share their best moments, interact with their community, and build relationships with their loved ones.\rDeveloped entirely in PHP and based on a MySQL database, Wolface integrates all the essential features of a modern social network. Users can register and log in securely, publish content, like, comment and share posts, and add friends to build their personal network. A personalized news feed displays the latest posts from friends, allowing for a fluid and immersive interaction.\rThis project was carried out in collaboration with a graphic designer, who was responsible for the design and ergonomics of the site, while I took care of the entire development, both front-end and back-end. This work allowed me to strengthen my skills in database management, user session manipulation, dynamic interface creation and data security. Thanks to this experience, I gained a better understanding of how social networks work and the technical challenges related to their design, while implementing a robust and efficient architecture.",

      "description": "Geogames is an interactive web game inspired by the Redbull GeoGamer concept, combining exploration, visual memory and video game culture. Halfway between GeoGuessr and a video game quiz, it invites players to dive into environments from different games and take on a double challenge: identify the title of the game and precisely locate their position on the virtual map of this world.\nThe idea was born out of frustration: not being able to play the official version of the concept, I decided to take on the technical and creative challenge of developing it myself. Designed entirely in pure JavaScript (without a framework) and ThreeJS, Geogames offers an immersive 3D experience, allowing players to observe their environment from all angles before making their guesses. The game also tests their knowledge and sense of direction through varied levels, ranging from great video game classics to lesser-known worlds.\rTo make the experience even more competitive and engaging, Geogames integrates a scoring system that allows players to record their performance and try to improve their result with each new game. The more precise the answer, the higher the score, thus encouraging players to improve their observation and knowledge of video games. This progression system provides a real challenge and encourages replaying to achieve the best possible score.\rThis project allowed me to deepen my skills in native JavaScript, in manipulating 3D scenes with ThreeJS, and in optimizing performance to ensure maximum fluidity. It also represents a reflection on user interaction, game design, and the implementation of an answer validation and scoring system, making the experience as fun as it is stimulating. Geogames is thus the culmination of a passion for video games and web development, combining creativity and technicality to offer an original and competitive experience to players.",
